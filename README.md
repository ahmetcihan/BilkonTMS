Purpose:

This project serves as a starting point for developers who want to establish network communication with Bilkon devices. It provides a foundational understanding of the communication flow and can be extended to build more complex applications.

Requirements:

    Programming language with networking capabilities (e.g., Python with socket library, C++ with Boost.Asio)
    Bilkon device model and its communication specifications (refer to Bilkon's documentation)

Functionality:

    Establishes a TCP/IP connection with the Bilkon device on the network.
    Sends commands or data to the device according to its communication protocol.
    Receives responses or data from the device.
    Parses and interprets the received data based on Bilkon's specifications.
